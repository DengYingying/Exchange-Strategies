# Exchange Strategies in Book Sharing System
By **Emma (Yingying) Deng & Lydia (Chuxuan) Sun**

WMlife Network Technology Company Ltd builds shared bookcases located in kindergartens to rent picture books at a low annual fee. WMlife builds bookcases of different sizes based on the number of students in the kindergartens. For all existing kindergartens in the system, WMlife has been choosing the same set of books for every kindergarten. However, now they are considering to supply different book sets to different kindergartens and exchange books between them each year to provide new books while reducing total cost. To minimize the time investment by WMlife, we modeled the problem as a periodic traveling salesman problem and used a modified Kruskal algorithm and brute-force to find the route with the shortest traveling time. We also constructed a feasible book exchanging algorithm. With our new strategy, WMlife can exchange books easily according to our instructions and significantly reduce cost in book reallocation.
